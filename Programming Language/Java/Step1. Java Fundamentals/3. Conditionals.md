*Java If Statement*

The if statement in java or any other programming language is a conditional statement, which executes only if the condition is true in the if statement. If the condition is false, then the if statement is skipped.

*Syntax*
```
    if (condition) {
        // code to be executed
    }
```

*Java If-Else Statement*

The if-else statement in java or any other programming language is a conditional statement, which executed in both of conditions are either true or false. If the condition is true, then the if statement is executed. If the condition is false, then the else statement is executed.

*Syntax*
```
    if (condition) {
        // code to be executed
    } else {
        // code to be executed
    }
```

*Using Ternary Operator*

The ternary operator is a conditional operator (?:) to perform the tasks of if-else statement. It is a shorthand way to check the condition. If the condition is true, the result of ```?``` is returned. If the condition is false, the result of ```:``` is returned.

*Syntax*
```
    result = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
```

*Java if-else-if ladder statement*

The if-else-if ladder statement executes one condition from multiple conditional statements.

*Syntax*
```
    if (condition1) {
        // code to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) {
        // code to be executed if condition2 is true
    } else if (condition3) {
        // code to be executed if condition3 is true
    } else {
        // code to be executed if all conditions are false
    }
```

*Java Nested if Statement*

The nested if statement is a conditional statement which represents "if block within another if block". Here, the inner if statement is executed only if the outer if statement is true.

*Syntax*
```
    if (condition1) {
        // code to be executed if condition1 is true
        if (condition2) {
            // code to be executed if condition2 is true
        }
    }
```
