*Method in Java*

A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the reusability of the code. We write a method once and use it many times. It also provides the easy modification and readability of the code.

The most important method in java is the main() method.

*Method Declaration*

The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as visibility, return type, name and arguments. It has six components that are called as method headers:

```
Access Specifier        Return Type        Method Name        Parameter List
       ^                      ^                  ^                   ^    
       |                      |                  |                   |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|    public                  int                sum            (int a, int b)  |-------> Method Header
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                           |                                |
                         {                 |--------------------------------|
                                                            |
                                                            V
                            //method body            Method Signature
                         }
```

*Method Signature*

Every method has a method signature. It is a part of the method declaration. Which includes the method name and the parameter list. The method signature is used to identify the method uniquely.

*Access Specifier*

Access Specifier of modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the method. There are four types of access specifiers:
- Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public access specifier.
- Private: The method is accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
- Protected: The method is accessible within the same package or subclass in a different package.
- Default: The method is accessible within the same package i.e, When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses the default access specifier by default.

*Return Type*

Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may have a primitive data type, object, collection, void. If the method does not return any value, then the return type is void.

*Method Name*

It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method. Suppose, if we are creating a method to add two numbers, then the method name should be add(). A method is invoked by its name.

*Parameter List*

Parameter list is a list of parameters that are separated by commas and enclosed in the pair of parantheses. It contains the data type and a variable name. If the method has no parameters, then the parameter list is empty.

*Method Body*

Method body is the part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed between the curly braces.

*Naming a Method*

While defining the method, remember that the method name must be a verb and start with a lowercase letter. If the method has more than two words, the first name must be a verb followed by adjective or noun. In the multi-word method name, the first letter of each word must be capitalized.

Single-word method name:
```
sum()
area()
```

Multi-word method name:
```
areaofCircle()
sumOfTwoNumbers()
stringComparison()
```

It is also possible that a method has the same name as another method name in the same class, it is known as method overloading. It is a technique to provide the multiple implementations of a method with the same name but different parameters.

**Types of Method**

There are two types of methods in java:
- Predefined Method

Predefined method is a method that is already defined in the java class library. It is also known as built-in method or standard library method. Some predefined methods are: length(), equals(),compareTo(),sqrt(), etc.

- User-defined Method
