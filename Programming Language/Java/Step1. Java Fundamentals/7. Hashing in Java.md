**Hashing in Java**

Hashing is a process of mapping the keys and values to a hash table by using a hash function. It is done for the faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the has function used. Using hashing in the process, you can easily store data in constant time and retrive them in constant time.

*Components of Hashing*

- Key: A key can be anything string or integer which is used to map the value to the hash table. It also determines an index or location in the storage of an item in data structure.

- Hash Function: The hash function receives the input key and returns the index of an element in an array called a hash table. The index is also known as hash index.

- Hash Table: The hash table is an array that maps keys to the values using a special function called a hash function. Hash stores the data in an associative manner in an array where each value has its own unique index.

Note: It is more like an array but array works on the index number whereas hash table works on the key. It is just like a dictionary where you can find the meaning of a word by using the word as a key i.e. the word is the key and the meaning is the value i.e. the value is mapped to the key i.e. data stored on the hard disk is stored in the form of key-value pairs.

*Hash Function*

The hash function creates a mapping between key and value, which is done using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions. The result of the hash function is reffered to a hash value or hash. The hash value is a representation of the original string of characters but usually smaller than the original string stored.
