**Loops in Java**

In any programming language, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

There are three types of loops in Java:

1. For Loop: The java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program serveral times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.

2. While Loop: The java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop.

3. Do-While Loop: the java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. Use it if the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once.
