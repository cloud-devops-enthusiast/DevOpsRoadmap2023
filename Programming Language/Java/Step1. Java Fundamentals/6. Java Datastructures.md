**Java Datastructures**

A datastructure is not just only used for organizing the data. Datastructures are also used for processing, retrieving and storing data. There are basic and advanced datastructures, out of that both are used in almos every program or software system that is needed to be developed.

**Classifications of Datastructures**

There are two classifications of datastructures, they are:

1. Linear Datastructures
    1.1. Static Datastructures
        1.1.1. Array
    1.2. Dynamic Datastructures
        1.2.1. Queue
        1.2.2. Stack
        1.2.3. Linked List
2. Non-Linear Datastructures
    2.1. Tree
    2.2. Graph

**Need of Datastructures**

1. Data structures modification is easy.
2. It requires less time.
3. Save storage memory space.
4. Data representation is easy.
5. Easy access to the large database.

**Linear Datastructures**

Data structures is that in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next element is called a linear data structure. The elements are arranged in a linear fashion. (PS: Linear means straight line)

Examples of Linear Datastructures are: Array, Queue, Stack, Linked List, etc.

*Static Data Structures*

Static data structures has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.

Example of Static Data Structures are: Array

*Dynamic Data Structures*

It is the opposite of the static data structure here the size is not fixed. Dynamic data structure can be randomly updated during the program execution or runtime which may be considered efficient memory (space) complexity of the program.

Example of Dynamic Data Structures are: Queue, Stack, Linked List, etc.

**Non-Linear Datastructures**

Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. The elements are arranged in a non-linear fashion. (PS: Non-Linear means not straight line), Which means in a non-linear data structure we can't traverse all the elements in a sequential manner.

Examples of Non-Linear Datastructures are: Tree, Graph, etc.


**Arrays**

An array is a linear data structure and it is a collection of similar type of data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together in one place. This allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively small amount of time. The first element of the array is stored at the lowest address indexed by a subscript of 0. There are different operations possible in an array like searching, insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.

*Characteristics of an Array*

1. Arrays use an index-based data structure which helps to identify each of the elements in the array using that index.

2. If a user wants to store multiple values of same data type, then an array is the best choice.

3. An array can also handle complex data structures by storing data in a two dimensional array.

4. An array is also used to implement other data structures like stacks, queues, etc.

5. The search process in an array can be done very easily.

*Operations Performed on an Array*

1. Initialization: An array can be initialized with values at the time of declaration or later using an assignment statement.

2. Accessing Elements: Elements in an array can be accessed by their index, which starts from 0 and goes up to the size of the array minus 1.

3. Searching for Elements: An array can be searched for particular element using linear search or binary search algorithms.

4. Sorting Elements: Elements of an array can be sorted in ascending or descending order using algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, etc.

5. Inserting Elements: Elements can be inserted in an array at a specific location but this operation can be time consuming because it requires shifting existing elements in the array.

6. Deleting Elements: Elements can be easily deleted from an array by shifting the elements that come after it to fill the gap.

7. Updating Elements: Elements in an arrya can be updated or modified by assigning a new value to a specific index.

8. Traversing Elements: The elements in an array can be traversed in order visiting each element exactly once.

*Applications of an Array*

- An array is used in solving matrix problems.

- Database records are also implemented by an array.

- It helps in implementing a sorting algorithm.

- An array can be used for CPU scheduling.

- Array can be applied as a lookup table in computers.

- An array is a best choice for implementing to a similar data type solutions

- It is used in image processing.

- It is also used in record management

- It is used in ordering boxes as well.
