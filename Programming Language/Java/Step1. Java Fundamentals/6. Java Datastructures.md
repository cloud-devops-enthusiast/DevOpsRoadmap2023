**Java Datastructures**

A datastructure is not just only used for organizing the data. Datastructures are also used for processing, retrieving and storing data. There are basic and advanced datastructures, out of that both are used in almos every program or software system that is needed to be developed.

**Classifications of Datastructures**

There are two classifications of datastructures, they are:

1. Linear Datastructures
    1.1. Static Datastructures
        1.1.1. Array
    1.2. Dynamic Datastructures
        1.2.1. Queue
        1.2.2. Stack
        1.2.3. Linked List
2. Non-Linear Datastructures
    2.1. Tree
    2.2. Graph

**Linear Datastructures**

Data structures is that in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next element is called a linear data structure. The elements are arranged in a linear fashion.
