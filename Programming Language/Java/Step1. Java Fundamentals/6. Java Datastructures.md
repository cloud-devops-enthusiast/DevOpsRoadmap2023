**Java Datastructures**

A datastructure is not just only used for organizing the data. Datastructures are also used for processing, retrieving and storing data. There are basic and advanced datastructures, out of that both are used in almos every program or software system that is needed to be developed.

**Classifications of Datastructures**

There are two classifications of datastructures, they are:

1. Linear Datastructures
    1.1. Static Datastructures
        1.1.1. Array
    1.2. Dynamic Datastructures
        1.2.1. Queue
        1.2.2. Stack
        1.2.3. Linked List
2. Non-Linear Datastructures
    2.1. Tree
    2.2. Graph

**Need of Datastructures**

1. Data structures modification is easy.
2. It requires less time.
3. Save storage memory space.
4. Data representation is easy.
5. Easy access to the large database.

**Linear Datastructures**

Data structures is that in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next element is called a linear data structure. The elements are arranged in a linear fashion. (PS: Linear means straight line)

Examples of Linear Datastructures are: Array, Queue, Stack, Linked List, etc.

*Static Data Structures*

Static data structures has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.

Example of Static Data Structures are: Array

*Dynamic Data Structures*

It is the opposite of the static data structure here the size is not fixed. Dynamic data structure can be randomly updated during the program execution or runtime which may be considered efficient memory (space) complexity of the program.

Example of Dynamic Data Structures are: Queue, Stack, Linked List, etc.

**Non-Linear Datastructures**

Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. The elements are arranged in a non-linear fashion. (PS: Non-Linear means not straight line), Which means in a non-linear data structure we can't traverse all the elements in a sequential manner.

Examples of Non-Linear Datastructures are: Tree, Graph, etc.


**Arrays**

An array is a linear data structure and it is a collection of similar type of data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together in one place. This allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively small amount of time. The first element of the array is stored at the lowest address indexed by a subscript of 0. There are different operations possible in an array like searching, insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.
