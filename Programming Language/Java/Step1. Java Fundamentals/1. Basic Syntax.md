*Java Program*

Java program is a collection of objects, and these objects communicate through method calls to each other.

*Class*

The class is a blueprint (plan) of the instance of a class (object). It can be defined as a template that describes the data and behavior associated with its instance.

Example:
```
Blueprint of the car is class.
```

*Object*

The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity that has behavior and state.

Example:
```
A Car is an object whose **States** are color, name, brand, etc.
Behavior: Running on the Road.
```

*Method*

The behavior of an object is the method.

Example:
```
The speedometer displays the speed of the car.
```

*Instance variables*

Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.

Example: Steps to compile and run a java program in a console.
```

javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

**Syntax:**

*1. Comments in Java*

Comments are the statements which are not executed by the compiler but used to provide information to the programmer about the specific functionality of the program and make the program understandable.

Example:
```
Single line comment:

// This is a single line comment

Multi-line comment:

/* This is a
multi-line comment */

Documentation comment:

/**Documentation comment*/
```

*2. Source File Name*

The naming convention for a source file should be strictly followed. The name of the source file should be the same as the name of the public class or the name of the file can be different name if it does not contain any public class.

Example:
```
HELLOWORLD.java  //Valid Syntax
helloworld.java  //Invalid Syntax
```

*3. Case Sensitivity*

Java is a case sensitive language., which means that the identifiers AB, Ab, aB, and ab are all different in java.

Example:
```
System.out.println("Hello World");  //Valid Syntax
system.out.println("Hello World");  //Invalid Syntax
```

*4. Class Names*

i. The first letter of the class should be in Uppercase (lowercase is allowed, but not recommended).

ii. If several words are used to form the name of the class, each inner word's first letter should be in Uppercase. Underscores are allowed, but not recommended.

Example:
```
class MyJavaProgram //Valid Syntax
class 1Program      //Invalid Syntax
class My1Program    //Valid Syntax
class $Program      //Valid Syntax, but not recommended
class My$Program    //Valid Syntax, but not recommended (Inner class Program inside the class My)
class myJavaProgram //Valid Syntax, but not recommended
```

*5. public static void main (String args[])*

The main() method is the main entry point into a java program, this is where the processing starts. Also allowed is the signature public static void main (String... args).

*6. Method Names*

i. All the method names should start with a lowercase letter.

ii. If several words are used to make the name for the method, then each first letter of the inner word should be in Uppercase. Underscores are allowed, but not recommended. Also, allowed are digits and currency symbols.

Example:
```
public void myMethod(); //Valid Syntax
public void MyMethod(); //Valid Syntax, but not recommended
```
