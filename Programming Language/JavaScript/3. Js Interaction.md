- **Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm**

- *alert*:

The ```alert``` function shows a message and waits for the user to press *OK*.

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  alert("Hello, world!");
  </script>  
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```
The mini-window with the message is called a *modal window*. The word "modal" means that the visitor can't interact with the rest of the page, press other buttons, etc, until they have dealt with the window. In this case â€“ until they press "OK".

- *prompt*:

The ```prompt``` function accepts two arguments:

```result = prompt(title, [default]);```

It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/CANCEL.

```title``` is the text to show the visitor.

```default``` is an optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field.

The call to ```prompt``` returns the text from the input field or ```null``` if the input is canceled.

Example:

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let age = prompt('How old are you?');
  alert (`You are ${age} years old!`); // You are 100 years old!
  </script>  
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
How old are you?
100
You are 100 years old!
```

- *confirm*:

The function ```confirm``` shows a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and CANCEL.

The result is ```true``` if OK is pressed and ```false``` otherwise.

Example:

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let age = confirm("Are you over 23?");
  alert(age);
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:

```
Are you over 23?
```

**Summary:**

- ```alert``` shows a message.

- ```prompt``` shows a message asking the user to input text. It returns the text or, if CANCEL or `key:Esc` is clicked, ```null```.

- ```confirm``` shows a message and waits for the user to press *OK* or *CANCEL*. It returns ```true``` for OK and ```false``` for CANCEL/Esc.

- **Practice:**

- Create a web-page that asks for a name and outputs it.

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let name = prompt("What is your name?");
  alert("Hello, My name is "+name+". Nice to meet you!");
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
What is your name?
Abhinav
Hello, My name is Abhinav. Nice to meet you!
```
