- **Data Types in JS**

- *Number*:

- The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers. There are many operations for number values:

*Infinity* represents the mathematical infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.

```
alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity
```

*NaN* represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation, for instance:

```
alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous
```

*NaN* is sticky. Any further operation on *NaN* returns *NaN*:

```
alert( "not a number" / 2 + 5 ); // NaN
```

- *BigInt*:

The Number type cannot safely represent all integer values larger than (2^53-1), or smaller than -(2^53-1). For these values, the BigInt type can be used.

```BigInt``` values are created by appending ```n``` to the end of an integer:

```
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

As BigInts are used for special purposes, they don’t support many operations. For instance, there’s no ```+``` operator to sum two BigInts.

- *String*:

A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes. In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

```'single quotes'```

```"double quotes"```

``` `backticks` ```

*Example:*

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let name ="Abhinav";
  let middleName = 'Virpal';
  let lastName = `Singh`;
  alert("FullName: " + name + " " + middleName + " " + lastName);
  </script>  
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
FullName: Abhinav Virpal Singh
```

- *Boolean*:

The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.

*Example:*

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let weight = 60;
  let height = 5.7;
  let value = weight > height;
  alert("value: "+value);
  </script>  
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
value: true
```

- *Null*:

The special ```null``` value does not belong to any of the types described above. It forms a seperate type of its own which contains only the null value:

```let age = null;```

- *Undefined*:

The special value ```undefined``` also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like ```null```. The meaning of ```undefined``` is “value is not assigned”.

Example:

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let age;
  alert("Age: "+age);
  </script>  
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
Age: undefined
```

- *Object and Symbol*:

The object type is special. All other types are called "primitive" because their values can contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). ```Objects``` are used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

The ```Symbol``` type is used to create unique identifiers for objects.

- *typeof*:

The ```typeof``` operator returns the type of the operand. A call to ```typeof``` with an operand returns a string with the type name.

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  alert("typeof: "+typeof undefined);
  alert("typeof: "+typeof 10n);
  alert("typeof: "+typeof 0);
  alert("typeof: "+typeof true);
  alert("typeof: "+typeof "foo");
  alert("typeof: "+typeof Symbol("id"));
  alert("typeof: "+typeof Math);
  alert("typeof: "+typeof alert);
  </script>  
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
typeof: undefined
typeof: bigint
typeof: number
typeof: boolean
typeof: string
typeof: symbol
typeof: object
typeof: function
```

The result of ```typeof null``` is *"object"*.

The result of ```typeof alert``` is *"function"*, because alert is a function.

- **Practice:**

- What is the output of the following script?

```
let name = "Ilya";

alert( `hello ${1}` ); // ?

alert( `hello ${"name"}` ); // ?

alert( `hello ${name}` ); // ?
```

Output:
```hello 1```

```hello name```

```hello Ilya```
```
