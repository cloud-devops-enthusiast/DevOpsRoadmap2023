**Basic Operators Maths**

- An Operand: This is what operators are applied to. For example we use ```5 * 2``` to multiply two operands, where 5 and 2 are the operands in the same.

- An Operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation ```-``` operator reverses the sign of a number.

Example:
```
let x=1;
x=-x;
alert(x); // -1, unary negation was applied
```

- An Operator is *binary* if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well.

Example:
```
let x=1, y=3;
alert(y-x); // 2, binary minus substracts values
```

**Maths Operators**

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Remainder (%)
- Exponentiation (**)

- **Remainder (%)**: The remainder Operator %, despite its apperaence, is not related to percents. The result of ```a % b``` is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.

- **Exponentiation (**) operator ```(a**b)```, where it raises a to the power of b.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  alert("Remainder of division of 3 and 2 is: "+3%2); //Remainder of division of 3 and 2 is: 1
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**String Concatenation using Binary +**

- Usually *+ (plus)* operator is used to sum numbers. But if used with strings, it merges (concatenates) them.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  alert('Hello '+ 'World!'); //Hello World!
  alert('1+'+'1'+'=11'); //1+1=11
  // If any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.
  alert ('1'+2); //12
  // It doesn't matter if the first operand is a string or the second one is a string.
  alert(2+2+'2'); //42
  // If the first operand is a string, then the second one is converted to a string too and so on.
  alert('3'+2+2); //322
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Numeric Conversion, unary +**

The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator ```+``` applied to a single value, doesn't do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let x=1;
  alert("+x : "+x); //+x : 1
  let y=-2;
  alert("+y : "+y); //+y : -2
  alert("+true : "+true); //+true : true
  alert(+""); //0
  let apples = "2";
  let oranges = "3";
  // the binary plus concatenates strings
  alert(apples + oranges); // 23
  // both values will be converted to numbers before the binary plus
  alert(+apples + +oranges); // 5
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Assignment**

*Assignment = returns a value*

- An assignment ```=``` is also an operator that assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a=1;
  let b=2;
  let c=3-(a=b+1);
  alert("a : "+a); //a : 3
  alert("b : "+b); //b : 2
  alert("c : "+c); //c : 0
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

*Chaining Assignments*

- Multiple assignments can be combined into a single line.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a,b,c;
  a = b = c = 2 + 2;
  alert("a: "+a+" b: "+b+" c: "+c); // a: 4 b: 4 c: 4
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

*Modify-in-place*

- We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in the same variable.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a = 1;
  // updating the value of variable named "a"
  a = 2;
  alert("Value of a: "+a); //Value of a: 2
  let name="Abhinav";
  alert("Value of name: "+name); //Value of name: Abhinav
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Increment/Decrement Operators**

- Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations. Here the Increment ++ increases a variable by 1 and similarly the decrement -- a variable by 1.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let counter = 2;
  counter ++;
  alert(counter); //3
  counter --;
  alert(counter); //2
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- The operator ```++``` and ```--``` can be placed either before or after a variable. If the operator goes after the variable it is in "postfix form": ```counter++```. If the operator goes before the variable it is in "prefix form": ```++counter```. Both of these statements do the same thing: Increase the value by 1.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let counter_pre = 1;
  let a = ++counter_pre;
  alert(a); //2
  let counter_post =1;
  let b = counter_post++;
  alert(b); //1
  // In the above line the variable returns 1 in form of alert because the postfix form **Counter++** also increments counter but returns the old value. (Prior to increment)
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- Using Increment/Decrement Operators along with other Operators

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let counter=1;
  alert(2*counter++);
  counter=1; //2 Because counter++ returns the old value
  alert(2*++counter); 
  </script> //4
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Bitwise Operators**

- Bitwise operators treat arguments as a 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.

- List of some such operators:
  - AND ( & )
  - OR ( | )
  - XOR ( ^ )
  - NOT ( ~ )
  - Left Shift (<<)
  - Right Shift (>>)
  - Zero-fill Right Shift (>>>)

- These operators are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise) level.

**Comma Operator**

- The Comma operator ```,``` is one of the rarest and most unusual operators. The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ```,```, after which the first expression is evaluated and its output is thrown away. Then another one is evaluated and returned the result. Example for this is given below:

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a = (1+2,3+4); //1
  alert (a); //7
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Note**: The comma operator has a very low precedence, even lower than =, so parantheses are important.

- **Practice:**

- What are the final values of all variables a, b, c and d after the code below?

```
let a = 1, b = 1;

let c = ++a; // ?
let d = b++; // ?
```

Input:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a =1, b=2;
  let c = ++a;
  alert(c); //2
  let d = b++;
  alert(d); //2
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
2
2
```

- What are results of the these expressions?

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
 alert("" + 1 + 0); //1
 alert("" - 1 + 0); //-1
 alert(true + false); //1
 alert(6 / "3"); //2
 alert("2" * "3"); //6
 alert(4 + 5 + "px"); //9px
 alert("$" + 4 + 5); //$45
 alert("4" - 2); //2
 alert("4px" - 2); //NaN
 alert("  -9  " + 5); //-9 5
 alert("  -9  " - 5); //-14
 alert(null + 1); //1
 alert(undefined + 1); //NaN
 alert(" \t \n" - 2); //-2
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
1
-1
1
2
6
9px
$45
2
NaN
-9 5
-14
1
NaN
-2
```

- Fix the addition

Input
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
 let a = prompt("First number?", 1);
 let b = prompt("Second number?", 2);
 alert(a + b); // 12
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
12
```
