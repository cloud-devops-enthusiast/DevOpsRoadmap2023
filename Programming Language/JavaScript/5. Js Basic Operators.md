**Basic Operators Maths**

- An Operand: This is what operators are applied to. For example we use ```5 * 2``` to multiply two operands, where 5 and 2 are the operands in the same.

- An Operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation ```-``` operator reverses the sign of a number.

Example:
```
let x=1;
x=-x;
alert(x); // -1, unary negation was applied
```

- An Operator is *binary* if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well.

Example:
```
let x=1, y=3;
alert(y-x); // 2, binary minus substracts values
```

**Maths Operators**

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Remainder (%)
- Exponentiation (**)

- **Remainder (%)**: The remainder Operator %, despite its apperaence, is not related to percents. The result of ```a % b``` is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.

- **Exponentiation (**) operator ```(a**b)```, where it raises a to the power of b.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  alert("Remainder of division of 3 and 2 is: "+3%2); //Remainder of division of 3 and 2 is: 1
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**String Concatenation using Binary +**

- Usually *+ (plus)* operator is used to sum numbers. But if used with strings, it merges (concatenates) them.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  alert('Hello '+ 'World!'); //Hello World!
  alert('1+'+'1'+'=11'); //1+1=11
  // If any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.
  alert ('1'+2); //12
  // It doesn't matter if the first operand is a string or the second one is a string.
  alert(2+2+'2'); //42
  // If the first operand is a string, then the second one is converted to a string too and so on.
  alert('3'+2+2); //322
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Numeric Conversion, unary +**

The unary plus or, in other words, the plus operator ```+``` applied to a single value, doesn't do anything to numbers. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus converts it into a number.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let x=1;
  alert("+x : "+x); //+x : 1
  let y=-2;
  alert("+y : "+y); //+y : -2
  alert("+true : "+true); //+true : true
  alert(+""); //0
  let apples = "2";
  let oranges = "3";
  // the binary plus concatenates strings
  alert(apples + oranges); // 23
  // both values will be converted to numbers before the binary plus
  alert(+apples + +oranges); // 5
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Assignment**

*Assignment = returns a value*

- An assignment ```=``` is also an operator that assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a=1;
  let b=2;
  let c=3-(a=b+1);
  alert("a : "+a); //a : 3
  alert("b : "+b); //b : 2
  alert("c : "+c); //c : 0
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

*Chaining Assignments*

- Multiple assignments can be combined into a single line.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a,b,c;
  a = b = c = 2 + 2;
  alert("a: "+a+" b: "+b+" c: "+c); // a: 4 b: 4 c: 4
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

*Modify-in-place*

- We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in the same variable.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let a = 1;
  // updating the value of variable named "a"
  a = 2;
  alert("Value of a: "+a); //Value of a: 2
  let name="Abhinav";
  alert("Value of name: "+name); //Value of name: Abhinav
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Increment/Decrement Operators**

- Increasing or decreasing a number by one is among the most common numerical operations.
