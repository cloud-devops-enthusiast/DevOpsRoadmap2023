**JavaScript**

- Javascript is a lightweight, interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
- Javascript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameters lists, function variables, dynamic script creation, object introspection and source code recovery.
- Do not confuse with the java programming language- Javascript is not "Interpreted Java". However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics and use.

- Javascript Code:

- The hello world program in javascript is:

Input:

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:

```
Before the script...
...After the script.
```
