**Conditional Branching: If**

- *The "if" statement*

The ```if``` statement evaluates a condition in parantheses and, if the result is ```true```, executes a block of code.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?','');
  if (year == 2015)
    alert("The entered year is 2015");
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?
> 2015
The entered year is 2015
```

If you want to execute more than one statement, we have to wrap our code block inside those curly braces.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let year = prompt('In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?','');
  if (year == 2015){
    alert("The entered year is 2015");
    alert("That's correct!");
  }
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
In which year was ECMAScript-2015 specification published?
> 2015
The entered year is 2015
That's correct!
```

- *Boolean Conversion*

The ```if(...)``` statement evaluates the expression in its parantheses and converts the result to a boolean. A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false, due to which they are called falsy values and other values are true so they are called "truthy".

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let cond=(year==2022);
  if(cond){
    alert("The year entered is 2022"+cond);
  }
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- *The "Else" Clause:*

Whenever we declare a ```if``` statement, you can give this option else clause for the moment if the condition is not specified.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  age=prompt("Please enter your age");
  if(age==22){
    alert("My birthday was on 04 may 2022");
  }
  else{
    alert("my birthday comes every year on 04 May");
  }
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
Please enter your age
age=22
My birthday was on 04 may 2022
Please enter your age
age=25
My birthday comes every year on 04 May
```


- *Several Conditions: "else if"*

Sometimes, we have to look behind several variants of the condition:

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let year = prompt("In which year you was born","");
  if(year==1999){
    alert("You was born in year: "+year);
  }
  else if(year>1999){
    alert("You were born before this year");
  }
  else if(year<1999){
    alert("You were after this year")
  }
  else{
    alert("You entered the wrong birth date");
  }
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
In which year you was born
year=1999
You was born in year: 1999
In which year you was born
year=2010
You were born before this year
In which year you was born
year=1997
You were after this year
In which year you was born
year=test
You entered the wrong birth date
```

- *Condtional Operator:?*

This is used to assign different values based on the conditions.

Example:
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Before the script...</p>
  <script>
  let AccessAllowed;
  let ContactNumber=prompt("Please enter your Phone Number");
  
  if(ContactNumber==9561622449){
    AccessAllowed=true;
  }
  else{
    AccessAllowed=false;
  }
  alert("Is Access is allowed: "+AccessAllowed);
  </script>
  <p>...After the script.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Output:
```
Please enter your Phone Number
ContactNumber==9561622449
Is Access is allowed: true
Please enter your Phone Number
ContactNumber==8459496962
Is Access is allowed: false
```
