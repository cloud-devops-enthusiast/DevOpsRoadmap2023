**What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for running and coordinating applications across a cluster of machines. This tool was made in such a way that it can be used in both public and private cloud environments, while managing the complete lifecycle of the containerized applications and services using methods that provide predictability, scalability, and high availability. Kubernetes were first developed by Google and then donated to the cloud native and computing foundation while being open sourced in 2014.

**Key Terms in Kubernetes**

- *Cluster*: A cluster is a set of nodes which are used to run containerized applications.

- *Node*: A node is a physical or virtual machine that is used to run applications and services. A cluster is made up of one or more nodes in which there is at least one worker node and at least one master node.

- *Cloud Container*: A cloud container is an image that is used to store all the softwares and dependencies that are required to run an application.

- *Pod*: A pod is a single or group of containers which is running on a kubernetes cluster.

- *Deployment*: A deployment is a set of pods that are running on a kubernetes cluster. It is used to define the state of the application and how many replicas of the application should be running.

- *ReplicaSet*: A replicaset is a set of pods that are running at the same time in a kubernetes cluster. It is used to define the number of replicas of the application that should be running at the same time.

- *Service*: A Service helps to describe the way in which the application represented by the pods can be accessed. Service mostly consists of the IP address and port number that is used to access the application, which also helps to control internal and external access to the application.
