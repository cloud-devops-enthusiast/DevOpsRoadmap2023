**Memory Management in OS**

The memory can be defined as a collection of objects or data in a specific format. This is used to store the data and instructions for the execution of the program or process the data. The main motive of the computer system is to execute the programs, at the same time it is also required to store all the data in memory which is required at the time for the execution. Here the CPU gets the instructions from the memory according to the value of the program counter. For doing all these complex as well as multi-programming things memory management is important.

Main memory is the main hub for all the processes and executions happening inside of a system. Memory management can also be reffered as large array of words or bytes, ranging in size from thousands to billions of data chunks. Main memory is a repository of frequent information shared by the CPU while doing operations like compute, I/O management, etc. Main memory is used to store the data which is associated with the process running on the CPU.
