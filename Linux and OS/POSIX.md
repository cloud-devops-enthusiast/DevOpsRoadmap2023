POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)

POSIX is a standard specified by the IEEE for maintaining its compatibility among the operating systems. It is like if any software meets to the POSIX standards then it should also be compatible with other POSIX compliant operating systems.

This is the reason why most of the the tools we use in Linux or Unix behaves the same way, just like for the ping or ps command which behaves in the same way in Linux and Unix.

The POSIX.1 is made up of four parts:

- Base Definations: This part provides the basic definitions for the specifications, which consists of the information about the terms, concepts, syntax, service functions and the command line.

- System Interfaces: This provides the details of the interface related terms and concepts and define the functional interfaces available to the applications accessingh POSIX-Conformant systems.

- Shell and Utilities: This part describes the commands and utilities which are made available for accessing the POSIX-Conformant systems that includes the command language used in those systems.

- Rationale: This includes the historical information about the standard contents and thus certain features are added or removed from the standard.

The standard of POSIX comes with the features more focusing on the application developement and portability other than the capabilities itself. The POSIX standard is made to be used by both the application developers and the system implementors.
