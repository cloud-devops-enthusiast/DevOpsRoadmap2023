**Virtualization**

Virtualization is the process which allows you for more efficient utilization of the hardware or physical utilization and one of the foundation of containers and cloud computing. In the process of virtualization, takes the help of the software which is used to create an abstraction layer over the computer hardware which allows every single element of your computer to be divided into multiple virtual computers which are commonly called as virtual machines(VMs). Every single VM (Virtual Machine) out of which can have its own operating system (OS) and with their own set of applications. Here every single VM acts as a separate computer which can be used as per the requirement.

As in todays world virtualization is a common practice among the Enterprises IT Architecture, extended with the use of cloud computing. Virtualization helps the cloud providers to provision the resources on demand with their existing hardware while saving on the cost of extra hardware, by this means the cloud users to purchase only the computing reources they need and pay only for the resources they use.

*Benefits of Virtualization*

- *Improved Productivity and Resource Efficiency:* Virtualization enables you to have more efficient utilization of the hardware resources with less resources and reduced IT staff which helps in improving the time spent over managing the IT infrastructure and the time spent on the business critical tasks. Before the virtualization, most IT infrastructure was underutilized and the Spending over the IT infrastructure was increasing, which leads to more cost and less productivity. In overall, the virtualization lets you have more out out of the existing hardware resources, while running more virtual machines on the same hardware with their independent operating systems and applications.

- *Easier Management and Easier Testing:* When you replace the physical hardware with the virtual machines, where it becomes easier to use and manage the policies written for the virtual machines. This also enables you to create automated IT service management workflows with more granular control over the virtual machines. Testing is also easier with the virtual machines, as the regular snapshots and backups of the virtual machines can be used at the time of emergency and testing. Additionally, the virtual machines can be used to install the services or applications onto the virtual machines and test them before deploying them as per the usecase. With the virtualization, you can have security policies to mandate certain security configurations based on the usecase of the virtual machine.

- *Minimum Downtime and Quicker Backups:* Backups can be taken of both the virtual server and virtual machine. Automatic snapshots are taken throughout the time, which guarentees that all the data is up to date. With these backups all the time going on, the downtime can be reduced and disrupt the productivity of the business. The admins can run multiple virtual machines alongside each other, and if one of the virtual machines goes down, the other virtual machines can be used to continue the work. But, running the multiple virtual machines on the same hardware requires more resources and can be expensive.

- *Faster Provisioning of resources:* Buying, Installing and configuring the hardware for each new application is more costly as well as more time consuming. As you already have the hardware, you can create the virtual machines and run your applications over them which is more significantly faster. You can also create automations with the virtual machines using the virtual machines management software and build it into the automated workflows.

*Types of Virtualization*

- *Network Virtualization:* Network virtualization is the process of creating a virtual network that can be used to combine the available resources by splitting up the available bandwidths into multiple channels or virtual machines. Each of these channels is independent from the others and can be assigned or reassigned to different users or applications. This kind of virtualization mimics the true complexity of the network by able to manage with seperatable parts of the network. In this kind of virtualization network administrators can modify and control these elements of the network without affecting the other elements of the network. This kind of virtualization is used in the cloud computing and data centers. There are two types of network virtualization: ```Software Defined Networking (SDN)```, which virtualizes the hardware that controls the network traffic routing called as the "Control Pane" and ```Network Function Virtualization (NFV)```, which virtualizes one or more hardware appliances which provide a specific network function, making those appliances easier to configure, provision and manage (Example, A firewall, Load Balancer or Traffic Analyzer).
