**Virtualization**

Virtualization is the process which allows you for more efficient utilization of the hardware or physical utilization and one of the foundation of containers and cloud computing. In the process of virtualization, takes the help of the software which is used to create an abstraction layer over the computer hardware which allows every single element of your computer to be divided into multiple virtual computers which are commonly called as virtual machines(VMs). Every single VM (Virtual Machine) out of which can have its own operating system (OS) and with their own set of applications. Here every single VM acts as a separate computer which can be used as per the requirement.

As in todays world virtualization is a common practice among the Enterprises IT Architecture, extended with the use of cloud computing. Virtualization helps the cloud providers to provision the resources on demand with their existing hardware while saving on the cost of extra hardware, by this means the cloud users to purchase only the computing reources they need and pay only for the resources they use.

*Benefits of Virtualization*

- *Improved Productivity and Resource Efficiency:* Virtualization enables you to have more efficient utilization of the hardware resources with less resources and reduced IT staff which helps in improving the time spent over managing the IT infrastructure and the time spent on the business critical tasks. Before the virtualization, most IT infrastructure was underutilized and the Spending over the IT infrastructure was increasing, which leads to more cost and less productivity. In overall, the virtualization lets you have more out out of the existing hardware resources, while running more virtual machines on the same hardware with their independent operating systems and applications.

- *Easier Management and Easier Testing:* When you replace the physical hardware with the virtual machines, where it becomes easier to use and manage the policies written for the virtual machines. This also enables you to create automated IT service management workflows with more granular control over the virtual machines. Testing is also easier with the virtual machines, as the regular snapshots and backups of the virtual machines can be used at the time of emergency and testing. Additionally, the virtual machines can be used to install the services or applications onto the virtual machines and test them before deploying them as per the usecase. With the virtualization, you can have security policies to mandate certain security configurations based on the usecase of the virtual machine.

- *Minimum Downtime and Quicker Backups:* Backups can be taken of both the virtual server and virtual machine. Automatic snapshots are taken throughout the time, which guarentees that all the data is up to date. With these backups all the time going on, the downtime can be reduced and disrupt the productivity of the business. The admins can run multiple virtual machines alongside each other, and if one of the virtual machines goes down, the other virtual machines can be used to continue the work. But, running the multiple virtual machines on the same hardware requires more resources and can be expensive.

- *Faster Provisioning of resources:* Buying, Installing and configuring the hardware for each new application is more costly as well as more time consuming. As you already have the hardware, you can create the virtual machines and run your applications over them which is more significantly faster. You can also create automations with the virtual machines using the virtual machines management software and build it into the automated workflows.

*Types of Virtualization*

- *Network Virtualization:* Network virtualization is the process of creating a virtual network that can be used to combine the available resources by splitting up the available bandwidths into multiple channels or virtual machines. Each of these channels is independent from the others and can be assigned or reassigned to different users or applications. This kind of virtualization mimics the true complexity of the network by able to manage with seperatable parts of the network. In this kind of virtualization network administrators can modify and control these elements of the network without affecting the other elements of the network. This kind of virtualization is used in the cloud computing and data centers. There are two types of network virtualization: ```Software Defined Networking (SDN)```, which virtualizes the hardware that controls the network traffic routing called as the "Control Pane" and ```Network Function Virtualization (NFV)```, which virtualizes one or more hardware appliances which provide a specific network function, making those appliances easier to configure, provision and manage (Example, A firewall, Load Balancer or Traffic Analyzer).

- *Storage Virtualization:* Storage virtualization is the process of pooling the storage resources from multiple storage devices and presenting them as a single storage device. Storage virtualization is mostly used in storage area networks. This kind of virtualization makes it easier to provision storage for VM's and makes the maximum use of the available storage over the network.

- *Data Virtualization:* Data Virtualization is about storing the data from the multiple sources and multiple applications, with multiple formats, at multiple locations ranging from cloud to on-premises. Data virtualization allows any application to access the data from any source, irrespective of the format, location or the type of the data. Data virtualization tools create a software layer between the applications accessing the data and the systems over storing it. The layer translates the application data request or query as needed and return the results that can span multiple data sources. This kind of virtualization is used in the data warehouses and data lakes.

- *Application Virtualization:* Application virtualization is about abstracting the layers of the application from the operating system while running the application software without installing it directly on the operating system. This is not about the complete desktop virtualization, because in this kind of virtualization only the application is virtualized. The OS on the end user's device will run as usual. There are three types of application virtualization: ```Application Streaming``` where the applications lives on the server which sends small components of the software to run on the end user's device when needed, ```Local application Virtualization (Application Isolation)``` where the entire application runs on the endpoint device but runs in a runtime environment instead of the native hardware and ```Server-based application Virtualization (Application Repackaging)``` .which allows the applications to run on a server that sends only the components of the application that are needed to run on the end user's device or only its user interface to the end user's device.

- *Desktop Virtualization:* This is about virtualzing a complete desktop virtualization, which includes the operating system, applications and the user data. This kind of virtualization is used to run the desktops on the virtual machines. This also allows the user to access the desktops from, anywhere and anytime. Mostly in these scenarios the desktops are accessed from data center or the cloud and access to it can be both more secure and portable. The operating system license does still need to be purchased for each user. There are two types of desktop virtualization: ```Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)``` which runs multiple virtual desktops on a central server and streams them to their user devices when they log in. In this way the organizations can provide access to variety of the OS's and applications to the users. ```Local Desktop Virtualization (VDI)``` which runs a hypervisor on a local computer enabling the user to run more than one additional Operating System on that computer and switch from one OS to another OS without changing anything about the primary OS.

- *CPU and GPU Virtualization:* CPU Virtualization is the process of creating multiple virtual CPUs (vCPUs) on a single physical CPU (pCPU). This kind of fundamental technology which makes the hypervisors, virtual machines and operating systems possible. Whereas GPU Virtualization is the process of a special type of virtualization that allows multiple virtual machines to share a single physical GPU. This kind of virtualization is used in the cloud computing and data centers for faster video, artificial intelligence (AI) and other graphic or maths intensive applications. This kind of GPU virtualization has two types: ```GPU Pass-through``` which allows to make use of the entire GPU to a single guest OS and ```vGPU Sharing``` which divide the physical GPU cores among the virtual GPUs and allows multiple virtual machines to share the same GPU.

- *Linux Virtualization:* Linux includes its own hypervisor, called the ```Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)```, which supports both Intel and AMD's virtualization processor extensions so you can easily create x86-based virtual machines from within a Linux host OS. As Linux is an open source OS, it is highly customizable You can create VM's running versions of Linux tailored for specific use cases or security hardend versions for more sensitive applications.

- *Windows Virtualization:* Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 both support Hyper-V, which is Microsoft's hypervisor. Hyper-V is a type 1 hypervisor, which means it runs directly on the hardware. Hyper-V is a full virtualization solution that allows you to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical server. Hyper-V is a free feature of Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 Pro. Windows Server 2016 also includes a free version of Windows Server 2016 Essentials, which is a simplified version of Windows Server 2016 that is designed for small businesses. Windows Server 2016 Essentials includes Hyper-V, which allows you to run up to two virtual machines on a single physical server.

- *Cloud Virtualization:* Cloud virtualization is the process of creating cloud computing models that can be used to run the applications and services by virtualizing the servers, storage and other physical data center resources. Here the Cloud Providers can provide the virtualized resources to the customers. Like, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which is used to virtualize the servers, storage and networking resources. Platform as a Service (PaaS), which is about the virtualized development tools, databases and other cloud based services you can use to build and run your applications. Software as a Service (SaaS), which makes the use of the software applications you can use on the cloud.
