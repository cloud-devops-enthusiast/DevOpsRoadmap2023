**Computer Networking**

Computer networking can be defined as the interconnection of multiple computing resources and devices with the ability to exchange the data and sharing them with each other. There are multiple devices that make the use of the certain set of rules called as communication protocol to transfer the information between the devices connected in a network via the wired or wireless medium. The computer network is a very broad term that is used to describe multiple types of the network that you can use to connect the multiple devices. In today's world, networking is an essential part of the business and personal lives, from the super computers to the small wearable devices or the IOT devices which we use in our daily life.

**Computer Network Working**

The working of computer networking is based on the the size of the computer network and the purpose of the network. If you have a small network you will need less number of the resources and the required tools to manage the network. But if you have a large network you will need more resources and the tools to manage the network. In a network The nodes and The links are the basic building blocks of the computer network. The network nodes can be defined as the devices that are mainly data communication equipment (DCE) like modem, hub, switch or router and on the other side there are Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) such as two or more coputers and printers. As there are both DCE and DTE are there, there is something required to connect them too, here comes the role of the links. The links can be reffered to as the transmission media which is being used to connect the DCE and DTE. The links can be both wired like the twisted pair cable, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable or the wireless like the radio waves, microwaves, infrared waves etc. Each device has an IP address, which helps in identifying a device. The IP address is a unique address that is assigned to each device in a network.

**What do computer networks do?**

The computer networks were created at the time of late 1950s for the purpose of military and defense. The network was initially used for transmiting the data over the telephone lines and had limited commercial and its scientific applications. The computer networks in today's world deliver more than the connectivity to the users. These all things are a critical part of the business and the personal lives. In today's world the computer networks can:

- Operate Virtually: In Today's world the computer networks can be operated virtually from anywhere in the world, which allows the physical networking infrastructure that can be partitioned logically for creating multiple "Overlay Networks".
